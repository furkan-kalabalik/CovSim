/**
 * This is pause play timer. Used to implement state changing timers of individual.
 * This timer takes duration in second and action to indicate what must be done when 
 * timer is up. After that this duration second converted ms. Since updates on timer done by 
 * swing timers and these are works in ms term. In every update of timer, using updateRate, timer
 * duration is decreased. When duration is become 0, the action is fired using dummy swing timer with 
 * duration 0 ms and action is processed.
 * 
 * The existence reason of that timer is when user pause gui, stopping swing timer. When this timer stops,
 *  individual stops updating itself and internal timers of individual is also stops.
