 * This state resembles individual is current in hospital and healing.
 * This class implements State interface. Since individual is in hospital,
 * it cannot start conversation with any other individual. Also cannot die, 
 * because it is in hospital and healing, this means death timer is stopped.
 * When individual's hospital time is end, it change its state to moving state by
 * calling moveInPopulation() and individual return to map with health.
 * 
 * Calling go hospital doesn't effect individual in this state since it is already in hospital.
