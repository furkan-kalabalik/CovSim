/**
 * This class resembles individual's moving state. In this state individual
 * is moving and changing location in simulation map. Since location change
 * individual can collide with other individuals and starts conversation and change state
 * to in conversation. Individual also can be infected, and access to hospital is granted, 
 * so individual can go hospital and stop dying. Individual also can't reach to hospital 
 * in time, so individual can die.
 * 
 * Since individual is moving state, moveInPopulation() call doesn't effect individual.
