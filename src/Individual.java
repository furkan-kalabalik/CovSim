/**
 * This class resemble one particular individual. It extends Rectangle class
 * so it hold 5x5 square place on GUI. It has additional parameters determined
 * randomly. It constructor takes simulation class as a parameter. Simulation class stands for whole
 * world parameters and communications that is needed for every individual. Individuals share
 * same world. Individual has constant speed determined randomly between [1,500] that will be update
 * amount of x, y coordinates every update of GUI. It has a social distance[0,9], mask indicator parameters masked(1.0)
 * or not masked(0.2) and these are used to determine in communication, if individual will be infected or not.
 * To utilize color of infected individual it has a health state enumeration healthy or infected.
 * Also every individual has conversation time for itself. This time is used to determine conversation time
 * between two individual.
 * 
 * Individual uses state pattern to determine its state. Its state changes by itself. So it maintain
 * state by self. By that it doesn't effect any other object other than itself. 
 * An individual can be in 4 different state. If individual is "moving", it is open for communication.
 * If there is a collision with other individual, individual change state to "in conversation". This also effects
 * other side of communication. In state of "in conversation", individual is closed for communication with other
 * individual. In conversation individual can be infected or can be infect other side of communication. This
 * infection determined with both parameters of communicating individuals. 
 * 
 * "In conversation" to simulate conversation there must be spend some time. After that time individual 
 * can be again in "moving" state. In state changes, individual uses its PlayPauseTimer class. This class holds 
 * remaining time in ms format. After that when GUI's main timer traverse all individuals and update them, 
 * this timer values updated and decreased by amount of refresh time of GUI. 
 * The reason behind that it, maintain one timer that updates all timers, so
 * when user pause simulation, all individual keep same state and position. Individual maintains different timers for
 * different states. When it is in conversation, it spend some time in conversation, that is maximum of two communicating
 * individual. When it timer is end, it tries to change its state is moving, if it is possible. 
 * 
 * If individual is infected, it death timer is start. In that time, if individual can't access to hospital,
 * it will die and change state to dead. From there user cannot interact with simulation.
 * 
 * If individual can access to hospital, know it stops all timers and go hospital. Hospital cure for every patient.
 * It also spend some time in hospital. After that time, individual returns to population with healthy state.
 * 
 * Timer events happens asynchronously, for that reason state changing functions is put in synchronized blocks.
 * When a timer is finishes it removes itself from timer list to prevent taking updates again. Also timers has
 * actions when timer is finished. These actions determines what timer does when it is finished. 
 * 
 * Individual also holds a thread. That is used when individual needs hospitalizing. When Individual get sick,
 * after some time it tries to go hospital but if hospital is full, it returns to population. So individual must 
 * move in population when hospital is full but also must try to go hospital to get heal. For that reason, this process
 * needs another thread and this thread does process of trying to go hospital.
